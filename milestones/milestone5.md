## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

i was able to implement my user features, and style them in the way I had envisioned.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

A lot of issues I hadn't anticipated arose. This included user validation and validating requests before they make changes to my database. This was more complex than I thought it was going to be.

### 3. What were some of the highlights or achievements that you are most proud of in this project?

My understanding and setup of the backend was good. It took me a while before understanding how to set the backend up.

### 4. Reflecting on your web development journey so far, how have you grown since the beginning of the course?

I have definitely grown as a developer, and I realize that the process is more complex than what I thought at first.

### 5. Looking ahead, what are your goals related to web development, and what steps do you plan to take to achieve them?

I will probably tackle more projects and practice implementing OAuth.
