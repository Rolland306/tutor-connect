## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

I think user stories were fairly easy to come up with. The project guides were very helpful in showing me how to plan for my web application with the user in mind.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

I'm doing the project by myself, and I had to think twice about features I could implement given the time period I have.

### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?
I would love to learn any web app design best practices and styling tips. Moreover, I would like to learn how we can develop web apps with performance in mind so that they run fast for the end user.
