## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

The project was simple to setup and making the issues and milestones was easy.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

I struggled to setup my backend tables. Especially trying to minimize the number of tables I need, and also making sure they're somewhat related to each other.

### Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?

I did not do much coding in this sprint, but I have more time in the upcoming week to get a lot of the coding done.

### Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

I think my features and user stories are not necessarily at risk right now, but there might be a need for me to update my Entity-Relationship diagram.

### 5. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

Gaining a better understanding of setting up backend tables.
