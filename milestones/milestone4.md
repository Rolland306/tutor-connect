## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

I was able to successfully implement all of the backend features, including all routes and controllers.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

I realized I had to add more forms for my frontend than I expected initally.

### Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?

No. I realized I had to add some pre-processing code and pages for my frontend before presenting the data I needed to show users. For example, I had to make sure I have 
some tutors and students enrolled in the system before displaying all the classes, chapters, and notes.

### Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

I suppose the feature where the tutor could place a maximum on the number of students they can help could be at risk due to time constraints.

### 5. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

Some UX/UI tips would be helpful.
